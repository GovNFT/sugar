# Velodrome Sugar 🍭

Sugar comes with contracts to help working with Velodrome Finance data!

## How come?!

The idea is pretty simple, instead of relying on our API for a structured
data set of liquidity pool data, these contracts can be called in an
efficient way to directly fetch the same data off-chain.

What normally would require:
  1. fetching the number of liquidity pools
  2. querying every pool address at it's index
  3. querying pool tokens data
  4. querying gauge addresses and reward rate

Takes a single call with _sugar_!

More importantly, the response can be paginated.

Main goals of this little project are:
  * to maximize the developers UX of working with our protocol
  * simplify complexity
  * document and test everything

## But how?

On-chain data is organized for transaction cost and efficiency. We think
we can hide a lot of the complexity by leveraging `structs` to present the data
and normalize it based on it's relevancy.

## Usage

Below is the list of datasets we support.

### Liquidity Pools Data

`LpSugar.vy` is deployed at `0xE180829A166d1e0bec705C1eB25758F645C9E317`

## Development

To setup the environment, build the Docker image first:
```sh
docker build ./ -t velodrome/sugar
```

Next start the container with existing environment variables:
```sh
docker run --env-file=env.example --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app -it velodrome/sugar sh
```
The environment has Brownie and Vyper already installed.

To run the tests inside the container, use:
```sh
brownie test --network=optimism-test
```

## Why the contracts are not verified?

Sugar is written in Vyper, and Optimistic Etherscan fails at times to
generate the same bytecode (probably because of the hardcoded `evm_version`).

## How to generate the constructor arguments for verification?

Consider using the web tool at https://abi.hashex.org to build the arguments
and provide the generated value as part of the Etherscan verification form.
